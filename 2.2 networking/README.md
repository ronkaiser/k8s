CHAPTER 2.2
Networking

In this lesson, we are going to take a quick look at the network overlay. In this case, we are looking at flannel. This is not an in-depth look at Kubernetes networking. Rather, the goal here is to understand how flannel configures the network and why this network is necessary in the scope of Kubernetes. Hopefully this lesson will help you understand a bit about networking in Kubernetes.
